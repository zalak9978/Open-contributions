# Open CV

## Python:
  1. Data Types
  2. Loops 
  3. Functions and exception handling
  4. Working with NumPy
  5. Working with Pandas
## working with images in python:
  1. read
  2. write
  3. show
  4. resize
  5. split and merge
  6. arithmetic operations on image
  7. image conversion (colour, grayscale, etc.)
  
 ## What I know about Computer Vision 
   I have very basic idea about waht is CV. Though I have some knowledge about working on images in using Python. Yet Open CV is a newer area for me.
   #### Idea about Open Cv
* Open CV is a cross platform library used to develop computer vision applications. Computer vision involves image processing, video capturing and analysis and includes face and object detection.
* Computer vision is the formation of meaningful descriptions of physical objects from their images. The output of computer vision is a description or an interpretation of structures in 3D scenario. Open CV has vast applications like in the field of robotics, medicine, automation industry, etc.
